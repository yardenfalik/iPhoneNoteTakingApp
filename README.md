# iPhone Note-Taking App
This is a mini project that I worked on.
It's a note-taking app for iPhone.
To use this app please go to the website and follow the instructions.

Just go to this [link](https://yardenfalik.github.io/iPhoneNoteTakingApp/) using your iPhone or iPad and save the page to the home screen.
